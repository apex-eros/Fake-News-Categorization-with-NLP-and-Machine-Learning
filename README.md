This project applies Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning to classify news articles as "Fake News" or "Factual News." The code covers multiple NLP techniques, such as POS tagging, named entity recognition, and sentiment analysis, followed by topic modeling and classification.

Key Features:
1.Exploratory Data Analysis: Visualizes the class distribution of fake and factual news articles.
2.POS Tagging & Named Entity Recognition (NER): Uses Spacy for token tagging and identification of key named entities, differentiating language patterns in fake and factual news.
3.Text Preprocessing: Cleans and preprocesses text with tokenization, stop-word removal, and lemmatization.
4.Sentiment Analysis: Utilizes Vader sentiment analysis to assess the tone of each article, comparing sentiment trends in fake and factual news.
5.Topic Modeling: Implements LDA and LSA to identify dominant themes, optimized by coherence scores.
6.Classification Model: Builds a classification pipeline using Logistic Regression and Support Vector Machine (SVM) to classify articles, achieving high accuracy and generating comprehensive performance reports.
